Introduction
============================================================================

Sometimes you want some skills that only occur after a specific condition
triggers (ie. death, receiving specific elemental damage, or allies
performing skills of a specific type). These skill triggers are now made
possible through this plugin.

Features include all (but not limited to) the following:

* Skill triggers that launch at the start of battle or winning a battle.
* Skills that let actors/enemies do one last hurrah before dying.
* Skills that function as a reaction to the user performing specific actions
  ranging from basic attacks, guarding, items, physical attacks, magical
  attacks, certain hit attacks, skills from specific skill types, or actions
  that inflict any specific kind of elemental damage.
* A total of 60 different auto triggers for a variety of situations.

============================================================================
Requirements
============================================================================

This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
of RPG Maker.

------ Required Plugin List ------

- VisuMZ_1_BattleCore

This plugin requires the above listed plugins to be installed inside your
game's Plugin Manager list in order to work. You cannot start your game with
this plugin enabled without the listed plugins.

------ Tier 3 ------

This plugin is a Tier 3 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
VisuStella MZ library.

============================================================================
VisuStella MZ Compatibility
============================================================================

While this plugin is compatible with the majority of the VisuStella MZ
plugin library, it is not compatible with specific plugins or specific
features. This section will highlight the main plugins/features that will
not be compatible with this plugin or put focus on how the make certain
features compatible.

---

Battle System - FTB
Battle System - ETB
Battle System - PTB

These battle systems are incompatible with Auto Skill Triggers. This is due
to their turn structures, making them highly incompatible with the way that
Auto Skill Triggers work.

============================================================================
Notetags
============================================================================

The following are notetags that have been added through this plugin. These
notetags will not work with your game if this plugin is OFF or not present.

---

=== Skill Trigger-Related Notetags ===

<No Auto Skill Trigger>

- Used for: Skill, Item State Notetags
- This prevents Auto Skill Triggers from occurring upon using this
  skill or item.

---

<Auto Trigger: condition>

<Auto Trigger x%: condition>

- Used for: Skill Notetags
- Turns this skill into an Auto Trigger Skill, where it will automatically
  be used if the 'condition' has been met.
- If using the x% variant, the Auto Trigger has a x% chance to occur.
  - Replace 'x' with a number value representing the chance to succeed.
- Skill must be usable normally outside of the occasion in order to trigger.
- This marked skill cannot trigger any other Auto Skill Triggers in order to
  prevent an infinite loop.
- Skills can have multiple Auto Triggers and will trigger upon meeting the
  conditions of any of them.
- Replace 'condition' with any of the below keywords:

  *Note1*: Being the target of an action means the potential target must be
    a part of the original scope, regardless of how the targets are changed
    up later by Action Sequences.

Plugin Parameters: General Settings
============================================================================

These are general settings used for this plugin. These are primarily used to
impose a limit on the number of auto skill triggers that can happen per
battler per turn (meaning each member in battle has that limit individually
and not as a whole). Generally speaking, we recommend imposing limits limits
like MP costs, TP costs, cooldowns, and the like.

This is because auto skill triggers, when left unchecked and reacting to
everything, can cause a runaway effect where the player no longer inputs
anything. Instead, it is best to put a limit (even if high) on the number of
auto triggers to prevent such a thing from happening.

If you still want seemingly unlimited auto skill triggers, change the
numbers to 100 or something, but keep in mind that we're not responsible for
runaway effects when the risk of it happening is already mentioned.

---

Settings

  Limit Per Turn (Turn-Based):
  - Turn-Based Only.
  - How many triggers per battler per turn?
  - Higher risk of runaway auto triggers at higher counts.

  Limit Per Turn (TPB-Based):
  - TPB-Only.
  - How many triggers per battler per turn?
  - Higher risk of runaway auto triggers at higher counts.
